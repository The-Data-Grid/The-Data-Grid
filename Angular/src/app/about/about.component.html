                The Data Grid is an evolving open source software distribution
                that helps communities monitor and improve their resource usage.
                It is composed of a web application and mobile data collection
                app for in-field data collection.

                To get an accurate and detailed picture of resource usage
                within our communities. Building an accurate and detailed
                picture of the collective impact consumptive activities
                make is the first step in recognizing areas in need of improvement
                and formulating comprehensive solutions to address them.
                When forming recommendations, we examine the intersection
                between financial, environmental, and social metrics.

                In 2019 students at UCLA started compiling utility audit
                data from various organizations on campus to get a big-picture
                view of campus sustainability and macro-trends. They realized
                many independent organizations had developed diverse and novel
                methods of studying usage but detailed documentation and
                 standardization was scarce. Knowledge was being
                lost or stored away. When data was available, the variety
                 of storages made them hard to compare. As they
                continued compiling, they saw the potential for a centralized
                 system to provide coordination and support
                for these diverse groups while maintaining their independence
                 and unique strengths. And thus The Data
                Grid was born.
